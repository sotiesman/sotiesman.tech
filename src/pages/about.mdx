## who am i

I am a backend developer in Ukraine. I am 18 years old and I am learning TypeScript, Rust and database management. Now I have a passion for learning ReScript.

I started learning server-side development in May 2019 (I was 13 years old). It's a big challenge because it's just one of my hobbies and I haven't taken any courses yet. I'm doing self-study on Discord. One of my favorite guilds in Discord is [The Programmer's Hangout](https://discord.gg/programming). There from the original founders I learned the programming base from 2020 I learned many skills in both server-side development.

At the moment, I'm a blank slate: Not married, Not in a relationship, Don't have many friends, Rarely go out, Living under a wreck. I had a rough childhood with no colors and no comfort. I live every day like it's my last. I believe in God. Not eloquent. I don't like to think about the consequences. And a spoiled notebook about being bullied at school. I wish to be on the lookout. I wish to burn like a candle even though I know the end, but to burn clearly like no one else.
